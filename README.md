# 📈 Market Price Prediction for Farmers - End-to-End ML Project

This project addresses a **real-time problem faced by the farming community** — the lack of accessible and reliable crop price predictions. We've developed a machine learning-based system that predicts **market prices** using real-world data, and deployed a complete **web application** using **Flask** and **Render** so that farmers can access this solution with ease.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- ✅ **Goal**: Predict market prices of crops based on historical and contextual features from the dataset.
- ✅ **Approach**: Performed extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, tried multiple models, and optimized for accuracy.
- ✅ **Final Model**: Random Forest Regressor (achieved **92% accuracy**).
- ✅ **Deployment**: Flask-based web app deployed on **Render** for farmer accessibility.

## 🔍 Features

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for training.
- Analyzed key factors impacting crop prices using EDA (visuals and statistics).
- Trained various models: Linear Regression, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and finally chose **Random Forest** for its robustness and accuracy.
- Web app allows users (farmers) to input conditions and instantly get price predictions.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **ML Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model**: Random Forest
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Deployment**: Render
